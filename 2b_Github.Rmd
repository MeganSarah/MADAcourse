# Overview
This document gives a brief explanation of Github and how we will use it for this course.

# Learning Objectives
* Know what Git and Github are.
* Know why one might want to use them.
* Have created and set up a Github account.
* Have joined the class organization.


# General Git and Github Information

## What are Git and Github 
_Git_ is what is called a _version control system_. The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the software tracks and records any changes made by anyone. Technically _Github_ is distinct from _Git_, it in some sense is the interface and _Git_ the underlying engine (a bit like _RStudio_ and _R_). Since we will only be using _Git_ through _Github_, I tend to not distinguish between the two and in the following refer to all of it as just _Github_. Note that other interfaces to _Git_ exist, e.g. _Bitbucket_, but _Github_ is the most widely used one.


### Why use Git/Github
You want to use _Github_ to avoid this:

```{r versioncontrol,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/phd_versioncontrol.gif")
```


_Github_ gives you a clean way to track your projects. It is also very well suited to collaborative work. Historically, version control was used for software development. However, it has become broader and is now used for many types of projects, including data science projects.


To learn a bit more about Git/Github and why you might want to use it, [read this article by Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/). **Note her explanation of what's special with the `README.md` file on Github.**



### What to (not) use Git/Github for
Github is ideal if you have a project with a fair number of files, most of those files are text files (such as code, LaTeX, (R)markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.

Github is less ideal if you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or Powerpoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.


### Some notes
Github has a lot of special terminology that takes getting used to. They have a [handy page with short descriptions of some of the important terms](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary). Some of the terms you will encounter soon _Repository_ (also often called _repo_), _User_, _Organization_, _Branch_, _Fork_, _Push_, _Pull_, _Commit_ and _Stage_. For some reason, the last term is not explained in the list linked to above. It basically describes th step after you made changes and before you commit them, you need to _stage_ them. It's more or less an automatic (and in my opinion somewhat useless) extra step, but you need to know what it means.


Github is an alternative to systems such as Dropbox. You can work locally on different machines and everything is backed up in the cloud (on github.com). The (sometimes annoying) difference to Dropbox is that the syncing between your local computer and Github.com is not automatic. So don't forget to pull before you start work on a repository and push once you are done! 

Because Github works similar to Dropbox, I have heard/read people say that it is a bad idea to locally store your Github repositories in a folder that is synced by Dropbox. If you do, the Dropbox sync process and the Github sync process can conflict, leading to a mess. __So for any github repository, store it locally in a folder that is not synced across your computers by another software (such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, etc.)__



## Github for this course
To get up and running, here are the quick steps I recommend you do. Below are a few further details:
1. Create a [Github.com]() account.
2. Download and install [Gitkraken](), link it with your Github account.
3. Post your Github user name into the `Github` discussion group.
4. Wait for an invitation to join the _epid8060fall2019_ organization. Then join.
5. Do the _Introducing Ourselves_ project for this course, for which you will be using Github.

Note that Github is widely used professionally and you might want to allow other people to see your Github presence. I therefore recommend using a future-proof, professional user name. 

If the quick install instructions are not detailed enough, follow thise in [Jeny's paper]() or her great online book [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/). Note that if you install Gitkraken, you don't have to separately install Git, since Gitkraken has it built in. It might still be a good idea to install it in case you want to use Github from RStudio.

For this course, I created what Github calls an organization with the name _epid8060fall2019_. The advantage of this is that we can have repositories inside that organization that only members can see. Once you joined the group, you can create repositories which are private, i.e. can only be seen by members. There are several repositories in that organization that you will use at some point, and you will be asked to create our own at some point.


## Further Resources and help
Github can be confusing. Start slow. Using the graphical interface (Gitkraken) makes getting started fairly easy. I'm also trying to give specific instructions whenever we do something new with Github. Jenny Bryan's book and paper are great resources. There is also a lot of good beginner material online. RStudio has built-in Github support. Personally, I prefer to use Gitkraken for all my Github push/pull/sync, etc. and then work on my project in RStudio separately. But if you prefer the workflow with the built-in Github, feel free to use it. Jenny's book explains how to connect Github and RStudio.
