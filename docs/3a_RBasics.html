<p><strong>If you are new to R/coding, this module could take a good amount of time. I estimate &gt;20 hours to properly work through things. So budget accordingly and plan ahead!</strong></p>
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this module, we will (re)-visit some of the basics of R (and RStudio). This is likley the one unit which will have the greatest diversity in pre-existing knowledge. Some of you might already have enough R knowledge that this will just be a quick refresher. For those among you who have not used R before, this unit (and everything else related to R in this course) will take a lot of time. Be prepared to put in a good bit of time and effort. If you do, I’m fairly certain you find it worth it. If you don’t, you’ll likely not get much out of the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge working with R and RStudio</li>
<li>Starting knowledge of R coding</li>
<li>Be familiar with the <code>tidyverse</code></li>
<li>Be familiar with resources that help you learn R</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-to-code" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning to code</h1>
<p>R (or any other programming language) is best learned by “doing it”. You will learn more R as we go along, but the focus of the class is on data analysis, so while I will provide you with resources to figure out the R bits, outside of this module we will not be focusing on ‘learning R’. You will do so anyway by going through the course. As with anything, as you practice more things will get smoother. You should approach learning to code with an attitude of <em>fearless curiosity</em>. You will get stuck, you will get frustrated with some weird error message in your code (still happens to me at least once a week) and you will eventually figure it out. Make sure of the great resources that are out there. They are all listed below in the <a href="./Resources.html">Resources</a> section.</p>
<p>This figure is <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/">from a good article</a> discussing the journey of learning to write code:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/blog/coding_is_hard_confidence_competence.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/">Read the article</a> from which this figure comes. Or read at least the first part and look at the first 2 figures.</p>
<p>My goal is that during this course, you will reach the beginning of the <em>upswing of awesome</em>, at least when it comes to being able to use R to perform data analyses. But to get there, you’ll have to go over the <em>cliff of confusion</em> and through the <em>desert of despair</em> and I’m confident that you’ll get there and won’t be stuck in the <em>hand-holding honeymoon</em>. In fact, at times I’m providing you less detailed instructions than I could to get you quickly to the stage where you have to figure out bits yourself. I guess one could say that instead of hand-holding, I let you stumble and fall some, and then will help you to get back up 😃. It might feel a bit more frustrating at least initially, but it’s a much better way to learn.</p>
<p>And of course it goes without saying that this is not a linear process. Even after many years of coding and using R, I regularly encounter the <em>cliff of confusion</em> and the <em>desert of despair</em> if I’m trying to do something new I haven’t done before and invariably get stuck.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-the-basics-of-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning the basics of R</h1>
<p>**Going through the resources below and practicing the material will likely take a good bit of time for those new to programming. I estimate 20+ hours! Try to get as much done as you can. You will also likely have to come back and revisit R coding throughout the course. Be prepared to spend the time to learn some coding. It is worth it 😃.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you already know a god bit of R, you can likely skip some of those assignments. Take a look, and if you decide you already know it, go to the next one. Or work through them anyway as a refresher.</em></p>
<p>RStudio is starting to develop <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers">a nice set of online tutorials they call Primers</a>. We’ll be doing several of those in this class. For now, we’ll start with the one called <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2">programming basics</a>. Work through this tutorial. Note that some of the bits surrounding the exercises are somewhat strange. You can generally type anything you want into the R boxes and you always get a ‘that’s right’ kind of message. The R package that is used to write this tutorial is in its early stages and not full featured yet. I’m sure it will get better over time. The whole tutorial should still work.</p>
<p><em>Note: There are 2 ways of assigning something to an object in R, one can write <code>x &lt;- 2</code> or <code>x = 2</code> and almost always that is the same. People argue about which way to do it. In the RStudio tutorial, they do it the first way. If you are completely new to programming, I recommend the first version, i.e. <code>x &lt;- 2</code>. The problem is that most other programming languages do it the second way, so if you learned coding in another language first (like I did), it’s more natural to write <code>x = 2</code>. It’s your choice. Just be aware that both notations exist and do the same thing. When write I code, I do a mix (without any logic to it).</em></p>
<p><strong>As you work through the primer programming tutorial, write down the solutions to the questions. Some will show up on the quiz.</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve gone through the RStudio tutorial, read and work through <a href="https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html">chapter 3 of IDS</a>. There will be some overlap between the RStudio tutorial and this chapter. That’s ok, repetition doesn’t hurt. The IDS chapter goes beyond the RStudio tutorial. Try to code along, by entering the code you see in the book into your R console. Also do the exercises at the end of some of the sections.</p>
<p><strong>As you do the exercises in IDS chapter 3, write down the solutions. Or write down the code in an R script so you can quickly access and re-run things. I will ask for some of the answers on the quiz.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, read and work through <a href="https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/programming-basics.html">chapter 4 of IDS</a>. This chapter discusses important but somewhat more advanced concepts of programming. Try to read and work through and understand as much as possible. If you are new to coding, it is likely you won’t fully understand everything on the first read. That’s ok. The important part is that you learn about these concepts and are aware of them. Once you start to need them for your analysis (and for any serious analysis, you will), you can then revisit the topics and dig in more deeply to get to the level where you can understand and apply them to your problems.</p>
<p><em>I recommend you try some of the exercises in IDS chapter 4, but it won’t be on the quiz.</em></p>
<p>Optional: If you want to keep going, or if you already have a good bit of R knowledge and want to learn more, the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/6">RStudio <em>Functions</em> tutorial</a> lets you explore some further concepts related to functions, as well as important topics such as flow control and branching.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>The tidyverse</h1>
<p>One of the strengths of R (and also a source of confusion) is that it is very flexible and almost always lets you do things in more than one way. The assignments above mostly introduced ways to interact with R that is sometimes called <code>base R</code>. This refers to the fact that you can do all the operations with what is directly built into R. But a lot of the power in R comes from its packages. Over the last few years, a group of individuals has developed (many) packages that make especially data analysis easier. One such set of packages, the most widely used one, is called the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyverse</code></a>. By using those packages, a lot of coding applied to data analysis becomes easier, more readable and more powerful. In this course, we will use the <code>tidyverse</code> packages and their functionality a lot. We will soon start using <code>tidyverse</code> functionality, but even if you will mostly be using <code>tidyverse</code> features for most coding, knowing some base R is very useful. Fortunately, they can easily be combined, so you can choose which style of coding to use based on what is easiest.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting help</h1>
<p>May be the most important skill for learning any programming language is to figuring out how to find and get help with any problems. Google, Stackoverflow and the Internet are your friend. If you have a problem with our code, it’s likely someone else had before you and asked a question (and probably got an answer). So search the web, you’ll find something useful most of the time.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="media/xkcd_wisdom_of_the_ancients.png" alt="Fortunately rare for R." width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Fortunately rare for R.
</p>
</div>
<p>In those rare cases where you cannot find information online that helps you figure out your problem, feel free to ask for help. There are many venues where you can ask your question. For this class, we have a slack workspace that is used by all the students and the instructor. Another highly recommended resource is the <a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com/">R for data science community</a>. They have a Slack workspace in which you can post questions, and they are very newbie friendly. The <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">Rstudio community</a> is another good place to ask questions. Finally, there is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, which is the biggest online help community. If you google a specific question, it’s likely you’ll get a link to some page on StackOverflow. If you have questions for a specific R package and that package is developed on Github, you can ask questions in the Gihub Issues section. For instance for the <code>learnr</code> R package (which is used to write the RStudio primers you explored above), you can find <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/issues">their issue page here</a>. Here is another resource, <a href="https://www.datahelpers.org/">a list of individuals who volunteered to answer R and/or Data Science questions mainly through Twitter.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, people complain that answers to questions they ask online are unfriendly or harsh. While this is at time true, consider that all the people providing answers on volunteers. They’re doing it because they want to do help others, they don’t get paid for it. It is therefore important that the person asking the question does not waste people’s time by asking poorly formulated questions or questions that have been previously answered. In general, those kind of questions get rude replies. If you have done your homework (i.e. searched online first to see if the answer is already avaiable) and can precisely formulate the question/problem, ideally with a reproducible example, the chance that you get an unfriendly reply is very low.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This module got you started on your path of learning R. In future modules we will learn more R specifically as it is related to data analysis. As you continue on your coding journey, keep in mind: <strong>The great thing about programming is that you can’t really “break” things too much. Worst case you get an error message. So experiment and try out anything you like!</strong></p>
