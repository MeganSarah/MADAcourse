# Overview
In this unit, we'll discuss how to structure a data analysis.


# Learning Objectives



# How to structure your analysis
* If you have an R analysis with not too much code, doing one R Markdown file is best
* If you have lots of code, it might make sense to have some code in a separate R file (with lots of comments), which is executed inside the R Markdown file.
* If you have several mostly independent parts of a project, you can do an R Markdown file for each.
* If you have analyses that take a lot of time, saving results from analyses into files and using other R/Rmd scripts to load them and produce figures and tables is useful.

Figure out what setup works best for you, while keeping in mind that it should be easily understandable/reproducible for a reader (or your colleague, PI,...)

# Further Resources
Several efforts to develop further tools to help improve reproducible research within the R system exist. Here are a few I know:

* [The `projects` R package](https://github.com/nikkrieger/projects) - meant to provide a framework for rather sophisticated projects.
* [R Open Science Reproducibility Discussion](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-07-30/) - website with links to various resources related to reproducibility in R.
