Welcome to the Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course website.

This is website contains almost all the content of an online course taught in Fall 2019 at the University of Georgia by [Andreas Handel](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/). Most materials are hosted here, some are on external sites and either linked or embedded from here.

For students taking this course at UGA, it is listed as EPID or BIOS 8060E. We will use eLC, UGA's learning management system, for the following additional features:
* Course discussion boards
* Online quizzes
* Course related announcements
